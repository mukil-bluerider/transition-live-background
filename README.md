# JS Live Backgroun
A simple and beautfull live background created with javascript and css only.


##How to use?
(in a near future there'll be a bower package)

Right now, to run this background you'll just need to add:
```html
<style>
  #gradient {
     position: fixed;
     width: 100%;
     height: 100%;
     padding: 0px;
     margin: 0px;
  }
</style>
<script scr="/path/to/file/ transition-live-background.js"></script>
<div id="background"></div>
```
inside your <body> tag
